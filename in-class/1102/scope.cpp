/*************************************************************************
 *
 * Exercise: Exploring Variable Scope
 * 
 * Commands:
 *   - Command  I: char varOne = 'A';
 *   - Command II: cout << varOne << endl;
 * 
 * Instructions: For each experiment below, complete the following tasks.
 *   1. Without actually making the change, predice if the program will compile.
 *   2. Make the change and confirm your prediction.  If the program does compile,
 *      predict the output without actually running it.
 *   3. Finally, compile and run the program to see if your hypotheses are correct.
 *
 * Experiments: (reset to the starting program after each experiment)
 *   - Experiment #1: Add commands I and II, in order, at POINT B
 *   - Experiment #2: Add commands I and II, in order, at POINT C
 *   - Experiment #3: Add command I at POINT C and command II at POINT D
 *   - Experiment #4: Add command I at POINT A and command II at POINT D
