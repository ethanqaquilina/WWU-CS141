# CPTR 141: Homework Assignment #4

## Problem Overview

In this assignment, you will write a program that prompts the user for a string of at least three characters.  It will check to make sure the user entered a string that is at least that long, and then report how many of the first three characters are the same.


## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must prompt the user for a string and store that in a single string variable.
2. You must then check to make sure the string is at least three characters long and print out an error if it is not.
3. Assuming the string is at least three characters long, your program must state how many of those three characters are the same.
4. Your code **must** produce the same output as the included sample program, ``solution.o``.  Run this program several times trying different passwords to make sure you understand what the output should look like.  To run the program, open a new shell and type:

`./student141/homework/hw04/solution.o`

## Grade Specification

Your homework assignment assigned a grade of E (exceeds expectation), M (meets expectation), R (revise and resubmit) or N (not assessable)  as follows:

- M -- passes all Submitty tests, but has a score of less than 100% on some (yellow or green bars)
- R -- fails at least one Submitty test (red bars)
