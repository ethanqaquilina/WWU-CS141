# CPTR 141: Homework Assignment #7

## Problem Overview

In this assignment you will write a program to create ASCII art using nested loops.  In particular, you will create an arrow of a user-defined number of rows using a user-chosen character.


## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must make use of nested for loops.  That means you must have a `for` statement within another `for` statement.

2. Your program must prompt the user for the number of rows in the arrow and the character to use to build the arrow.  If the user enters a negative number of rows, your program must display an error message and prompt them again (input validation).

3. Finally, your output **must** match the output of the included program, ``solution.o``.  Run this program several times using different options to make sure you understand what that output should look like. To run the program, you can enter a full path to the executable in a terminal:

`./student141/homework/hw07/solution.o`

## Grade Specification

Your homework assignment assigned a grade of E (exceeds expectation), M (meets expectation), R (revise and resubmit) or N (not assessable)  as follows:

- E -- passes all Submitty tests with a score of 100% (green bars, no compiler warnings)
- M -- passes all Submitty tests, but has a score of less than 100% on some (yellow or green bars)
- R -- fails at least one Submitty test (red bars)
- N -- no substantive changes made to template, or nothing submitted
