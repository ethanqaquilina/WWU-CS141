# CPTR 141: Homework Assignment #9

## Problem Overview

In this homework assignment you will be writing two `void` functions.  These functions each take two  integer parameters.  The functions accomplish the following tasks.

* The first function prints out the numbers from the first argument up to and including the number passed as the second argument counting by the first argument (i.e. if the arguments are 2 and 10, it prints 2 4 6 8 10).
* The second function prints out a message stating if the first argument is a factor of the second argument.

To help you get started, the `main` program for this assignment has been provided to you.  You should not alter the code in the `main` function.  Your task is just to define the two missing functions within this same file.


## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. You must define the two functions called in the provided `main` program.
2. You may not alter the `main` program code in any way.
3. Your code must be formatted correctly (use the "Format Document" command to do this).
4. Finally, your output **must** match the output of the included program, ``solution.o``.  Run this program several times using different options to make sure you understand what that output should look like.
    To run the program, you can enter a full path to the executable in a terminal window:

`./student141/homework/hw09/solution.o`

## Grade Specification

Your homework assignment assigned a grade of E (exceeds expectation), M (meets expectation), R (revise and resubmit) or N (not assessable)  as follows:

- E -- passes all Submitty tests with a score of 100% (green bars, no compiler warnings)
- M -- passes all Submitty tests, but has a score of less than 100% on some (yellow or green bars)
- R -- fails at least one Submitty test (red bars)
- N -- no substantive changes made to template, or nothing submitted
